##EXERCISES
1. Perform the following task using NLTK: Tokenize and tag some text, identify named
entities, display a parse tree and find the ambiguity of the sentence using parse tree.
2. Perform t-Test and Chi-Square test to check whether a given sequence of words is a
collocation or not.

problem.
5. Implement the forward and backward procedures using Hidden Markov Model to find
the probability of a word sequence.
